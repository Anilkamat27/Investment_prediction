Our project is focused on stock price prediction using time series analysis and machine learning techniques. We leverage historical stock data, employ ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for forecasting, and evaluate various model configurations. It is a one-click stock price prediction solution that automatically fetches and transforms historical stock data from the internet with a single click.
It checks for stationarity and identifies the best values for 'p,' 'd,' and 'q' to train an ARIMA model, enabling you to predict the next day's stock price based on the entered stock symbol.
